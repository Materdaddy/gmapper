= Introduction =

This project is going to be written to easily create custom google maps using your own google maps API key for your web page.

The plans are to start simple, but design the code in an object oriented way such that scalability is easily maintained.  This way in the future, the core code can be used to create many different types of google maps not only with geotagged photos, but with waypoints, gpx files, or anything else you can imagine.
